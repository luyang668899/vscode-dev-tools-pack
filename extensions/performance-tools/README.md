## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Command not found**: Make sure the extension is installed and VS Code is reloaded
- **No analysis results**: The extension uses simulated analysis for demonstration purposes
- **Resource monitoring not working**: Check that your system allows resource monitoring

### Known Limitations

- The extension uses simulated performance data for demonstration purposes
- Resource monitoring may have limited accuracy in the simulation
- Optimization suggestions are based on common patterns
